            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>
              The mission of the FarmAssist is to empower farmers by creating a direct link between them and vendors.
              We aim to eliminate transportation costs and other intermediaries, allowing farmers to sell their goods directly.
              Additionally, we support landless farmers by helping them find available land for lease, connecting them directly with landowners.
              Our mission extends to financial assistance, where donations from people are transformed into essential agricultural products for farmers.
